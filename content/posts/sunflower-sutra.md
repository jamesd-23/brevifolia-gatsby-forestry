Around the world, eCommerce teams face a dilemma. Never has the social disruption fear and social change been greater, conversely never have they been so much in demand.

For a large number of businesses, eCommerce is the only part that is functioning and generating the much-needed revenue to keep it running. 

While you may rightly feel cautious about being seen to jump on the bandwagon or cash in on the current situation, there are some common-sense actions you can take to give your customers confidence in purchasing from you. 

I feel that people are looking for normality wherever they can find it and shopping online is one way we can deliver that. 

In addition with millions stuck at home for an unknown period of time, the need for your product or service may be higher than usual and its purchase a way of sparking joy. 

So what can you do to ensure your site builds confidence with customers during this time?

**#1 – Reassure customers that you are operating as normal**

With so much confusion around the current lockdown and business shutting on a daily basis you need to add a prominent message to your site so everyone knows their order will be processed and there will be someone at the end of the line if they need help.

**#2 – Be honest & open about delivery times**

Everyone understands that delivery times may be impacted so be clear and honest with customers about how long their order will take to deliver, even if it is longer than usual. Try and be as specific as possible by either:

* Giving a specific delivery date “Your order will be delivered on” if your site has that capability.
* Indicating estimated days to delivery “Your order will be delivered in 5 days”

**#3 – Indicate that delivery will be contact-free if possible**

Most couriers are offering contact or touch-free delivery so talk to your delivery company and ensure that is happening. Once confirmed, ensure you push that message on-site.

**#4 – Extend trial and returns periods**

No-one wants to think about returning a package at the moment so if possible extend your returns period by a substantial amount (say 60 or 90 days. This will remove returns as a purchase blocker. This may also have the effect of reducing the returns rate long term. 

**#5 – Create positive feeling with a value-add**

Offer a value-add such as Free Delivery to create a positive feeling around purchasing from your site and give costumes the feeling of getting a good deal. This can also be a great way of differentiating from your competitors.

While the points above relate directly to on-site messaging it is obviously critical that it is aligned closely to a strong CRM program engaging and informing customers. 

The situation is evolving quickly and it is important we evolve with it, monitor competitors closely and ensure our customers feel valued and informed. 

After all, we are relying on them now more than ever.

I hope these have been useful.

Good luck and best wishes.
